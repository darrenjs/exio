Notes on making a release
-------------------------

* Update these release notes

* Change the version number in the configure.ac script, and in the libexio makefile.

* Make a branch:

NEWVER=1.5.0
SRC=file:///home/darrens/system/subversion/exio/exio
DEST=file:///home/darrens/system/subversion/exio/branches/${NEWVER}
svn copy --parents  ${SRC} ${DEST}


IN PROGRESS
-----------

1.5.0
-----

* IO handling for admin sessions now uses a thread pool, instead of there
  being two dedicated threads per session.

* new fields have been added to the alert call, e.g. the severity rating.

* lib version-info: 2:0:0  (Major updated due to interface change).

* slow consumers will now be dropped

1.4.3 - 02/09/13 - r154
-----

* fixed new-column bug, where a row was updated multiple times when a new
  column was added (and added example program to test) r140

* fixed bug where RowKey and RowLastUpdated could be modified by client. r140

* admin help can now take name of another admin, to display the long help. r141

* result codes values from admin commands are now passed out of the admin
  main. r141

* server socket is now created in the admin start() method.

* synthetic tables, used in reponses, use row_ prefix in tables, which is the
  convention for tableupdate. This allows the admin binary to present the
  collection of rows in the order intended by the server. r142

* list of admins is presented in case-insensitive order. r143

* --version option to admin. r144

* added test function to the example server for sending large messages. r146

* SAM0101 protocol change, which supports messages longer than 99999 (which is
  the limitation of SAM0100). Added expandable encoding and socket buffer
  classes to support this.

1.4.2 [r136]
-----

* moved AdminSession to a public header.  This is to allow client applications
  to use exio for establishing connections.  This is first attempt at doing
  this; might need to be changed, because perhaps the AdminSession has too
  much clutter to be used in this standalone fashion.

* heartbeats are now sent irrespective of session activity.

* added slow_consumer test tool, to debug issues with slow consumers

* txContainer supports merge(). Added as part of meta-update feature.

* added copy_rowkeys

1.4.1 [r118]
-----

* 'diags' command will now show the number of queued bytes, that are waiting
  to be written on an admin session.

1.3
----

* Session ID are now single digit, and Session ID container is now just a flat
  array.

* using a version number to match the library version number, eg, 1.3 and lib 1.0.3

1.2.1
-----

* First production release
